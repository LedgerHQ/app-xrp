/**
 * This file implements a loading screen that can be displayed while performing
 * a time-consuming action. The implementation has been designed to be as
 * efficient as possible while maintaining a reliable function.
 *
 * In essence, the loading screen implementation consists of three steps after
 * its appearance has been requested:
 *
 * 1. Request the display of loading_ui. This UI has a dummy last element that
 *    will never be displayed. The reason for this is that interrupts to the
 *    rendering of the UI (such as calling a time-consuming function) will
 *    cause the element that is currently rendering to either disappear or
 *    flicker.
 *
 * 2. Once the dummy element is displayed, a timer is set to re-render the UI
 *    as soon as possible. It is not possible to execute the time-consuming
 *    action here because the UI has not yet been shown in its complete form.
 *
 * 3. The second time the UI is rendered the loading text is clearly visible
 *    on the display, and the time-consuming function can thus be executed.
 *    To avoid that the preprocessor executes this function again, a state
 *    enum is set before the function is executed. This is done because the
 *    UI might be rendered a third time before the function finishes
 *    executing.
 *
 * Note: Since this loading screen implementation is dependent on functionality
 * in the BAGL UI system it has not been rewritten using Flow UI.
