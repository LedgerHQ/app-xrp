# XRP Wallet App for Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the XRP wallet app that makes it possible to securely store XRP and assets issued on the XRP Ledger using Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X devices. 

To add Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X support in your application, please see the
NPM package [hw-app-xrp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp)
and the examples below. 

## Features
The XRP wallet app comes with the following features:

  - Support for all transaction types:
    - AccountSet
    - AccountDelete
    - CheckCancel
    - CheckCash
    - CheckCreate
    - DepositPreauth
    - EscrowCancel
    - EscrowCreate
    - EscrowFinish
    - OfferCancel
    - OfferCreate
    - Payment
    - PaymentChannelClaim
    - PaymentChannelCreate
    - PaymentChannelFund
    - SetRegularKey
    - SignerListSet
    - TrustSet
  - Support for all transaction common fields such as memos
  - Support for issued assets such as SOLO, stocks and ETFs
  - Support for signing on behalf of others
  - Support for multi-signing
  - Unified UI across Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X

## User Interface
The user interface primarily consists of the idle menu and the transaction
review menu.

### Idle Menu
Upon starting the app on your device you are immediately greeted by
the idle menu. This menu, as the name implies, is used when the device is in
its idle state. At this point, an external application may initiate a
transaction, which opens up the review menu.

### Review Menu
When reviewing a transaction the entire UI is dedicated to displaying the
transaction details. You can page through all the details by using the left
and right buttons on your device, as indicated by arrows on the screen.

Fields in arrays are suffixed with their array index in square brackets. See example below.

PathSet fields have their index information shown in square brackets on the
form `[Pi: Sj]`, where `i` is the path index and `j` is the step index within
that path. See example below.

In order to take action on the transaction, you must first page through and review all transaction details. The last two items in the review menu are 'Sign transaction' and 'Reject'.

![Approval menu](img/approval-menu.png)

Page to either 'Sign transaction' or 'Reject' and press both buttons simultaneously to confirm your action.

## Usage
In order to initiate transactions from NodeJS or a browser client, the library
[hw-app-xrp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp) can be used.

An example of a basic payment transaction using this library is shown below:
```javascript
import Transport from "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-node-hid";
// import Transport from "@ledgerhq/hw-transport-u2f"; // for browser
import Xrp from "@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp";
import { encode } from 'ripple-binary-codec';

function establishConnection() {
    return Transport.create()
        .then(transport => new Xrp(transport));
}

function fetchAddress(xrp) {
    return xrp.getAddress("44'/144'/0'/0/0").then(deviceData => {
        return {
            xrp,
            address: deviceData.address,
            publicKey: deviceData.publicKey.toUpperCase()
        }
    });
}

function signTransaction(context, transaction) {
    const preparedTransaction = {
        Account: context.address,
        SigningPubKey: context.publicKey,
        ...transaction
    };

    const transactionBlob = encode(preparedTransaction);

    console.log('Sending transaction to device for approval...');
    return context.xrp.signTransaction("44'/144'/0'/0/0", transactionBlob);
}

const transactionJSON = {
    TransactionType: "Payment",
    Destination: "rTooLkitCksh5mQa67eaa2JaWHDBnHkpy",
    Amount: "1000000",
    Fee: "15",
    Flags: 2147483648,
    Sequence: 57,
};

establishConnection()
    .then(xrp => fetchAddress(xrp))
    .then(context => signTransaction(context, transactionJSON))
    .then(signature => console.log(`Signature: ${signature}`))
    .catch(e => console.log(`An error occurred (${e.message})`));
```

### Advanced Usage
#### Multi-signing a Transaction
It is also possible to perform parallel multi-signing using the XRP wallet 
app. This is done by sourcing a list of signatures for the transaction
and appending them to the `Signers` field of the transaction before submitting 
it for processing. An example of combining a couple of externally sourced signatures 
with a signature of the Ledger device is shown below (uses imports and functions declared in previous example).

```javascript
const transactionJSON = {
    Account: "r4PCuDkjuV2e23xVP8ChkVxo1aG2Ufpkjb",
    TransactionType: "Payment",
    Destination: "rTooLkitCksh5mQa67eaa2JaWHDBnHkpy",
    Amount: "1000000",
    Fee: "15",
    Flags: 2147483648,
    Sequence: 47,
    SigningPubKey: "" // Must be blank
};

// Sourced externally from other signing parties, replace "..." with actual values.
const otherSigners = [
    {
        Signer: {
            Account: "...",
            SigningPubKey: "...",
            TxnSignature: "..."
        }
    },
    {
        Signer: {
            Account: "...",
            SigningPubKey: "...",
            TxnSignature: "..."
        }
    }
];

function retrieveSignerData(transaction) {
    return establishConnection()
        .then(xrp => fetchAddress(xrp))
        .then(context => {
            return signTransaction(context, transaction)
                .then(signature => {
                    return {
                        Signer: {
                            Account: context.account,
                            SigningPubKey: context.publicKey,
                            TxnSignature: signature.toUpperCase()
                        }
                    }
                });
        })
        .catch(e => console.log(`An error occurred (${e.message})`));
}

retrieveSignerData(transactionJSON)
    .then(signer => {
        return {
            ...transactionJSON,
            Signers: [
                ...otherSigners,
                signer
            ]
        }
    })
    .then(transaction => console.log(transaction))
    .catch(e => console.log(`An error occurred (${e.message})`));
```

### Additional Notes
From version 2.0.0 of the XRP wallet app it is possible to sign larger
transactions than in previous versions. In order to enable support for larger transactions
there have been slight modifications to the transport protocol, which is used to 
communicate between the client and the device.

The protocol changes are fully backwards-compatible with previous versions of
[hw-app-xrp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp), but in order
to sign larger transactions you must use version 5.12.0 or above of [hw-app-xrp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/hw-app-xrp).

### Limitations
Because of resource constraints the following limits apply for the respective
hardware wallet:

#### Ledger Nano S
- Maximum fields per transaction: 24 fields
- Maximum displayed field value length: 128 characters
- Maximum transaction size: 800 bytes
- Maximum number of elements per array field: 8 elements
- Multi-sign support: Parallel only

#### Ledger Nano X
- Maximum fields per transaction: 60 fields
- Maximum displayed field value length: 1024 characters
- Maximum transaction size: 10 000 bytes
- Maximum number of elements per array field: 8 elements
- Multi-sign support: Parallel only

## Building
Make sure that you have configured a development environment as outlined in [the development
documentation](https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userspace/getting_started.html)
for Ledger devices. Then run make from the repository root to build the app: 
```sh
make
```

## Installing
To upload the app to your device, run the following command:
```sh
make load
```

## Testing
Manual testing can be conducted with the help of the testing utility 
[TowoLabs/ledger-tests-xrp](https://github.com/TowoLabs/ledger-tests-xrp).
Make sure that your device is running the latest firmware and then follow
the instructions in the test repository.
